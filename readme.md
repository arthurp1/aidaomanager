## AI DAO Manager
The AI DAO Manager lets you use "rules" around productivity and accountability with your team and track it with a webextension.  AI agents help generating rules, tracking input/output, provide evaluations, and give coaching and reminders—without micromanagement.

### ⚠️ Problem:
Your team, DAO, or friend group is hyped but struggles to get things done. You need minimum accountability that respects intrinsic motivation and social dynamics.

Things that kill motivation:

- Hierarchies, office politics
- Policing peers instead of building
- Leaderboards (Social Comparison Theory)
- Performance-based rewards / ineffective gamification (Goodhart's Law)

### ✅ Solution:
AI managers that imitate human-like management—giving private qualitative feedback and only notifying the group when necessary. Never revealing quantitative performance data, only qualitative feedback through an AI.

### ⚙️ How It Works:
1. User login with Connect Wallet (Coinbase Smart Wallet)
2. Create or Join Organization
3. Create Roles → Roles give access to "Tasks" with related rewards based on performance and effort
4. Create Tasks & Requirements → The team lists common tasks with performance measures.
6. Create Requirements  → AI suggests requirements based on Task and related tools
7. Suggest Rules→ AI suggests performance thresholds and rules based on available Tool Tracking Data
8. Initialize Task & Tracking Agents → In the background AI agents are tracking tool analytics and store it in Nillion Database for privacy.
9. Track Earnings & Potential Rewards → Uses Coinbase Agentkit to fetch earnings data and future potential rewards.
10. Possibility for arbitration - Request to see the data against payment.
