## Now:
- nillion database
- first run postSchema.js when launching server to create the schema ID (this should be output and stored somewhere)
- when running discord.js for getting data, ((FIRST FILTER?)) then store the nillion ID somewhere
- use nillion ID to retreive the data.

## Later:
- use frontend_rules.json to get more quantative measures
- update tools_docs.json from backend to know what is possible in frontend
